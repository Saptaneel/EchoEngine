# EchoEngine

**EchoEngine** is a simple yet powerful text-to-speech application built using Python's `pyttsx3` library. This project allows users to input text, which is then converted to speech, demonstrating practical applications of text-to-speech technology.

## Features

- **Interactive Text-to-Speech**: Users can type any text, and the application will convert it to speech in real-time.
- **Continuous Interaction**: The program runs in a loop, allowing multiple text inputs until the user decides to stop.
- **Easy Termination**: Users can type "stop" to end the application gracefully.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used to build the application.
- **pyttsx3**: A text-to-speech conversion library in Python.

## Project Structure

- **echoengine.py**: The main script containing the text-to-speech functionality.

## How It Works

- **Text Input**: The user is prompted to enter the text they want to convert to speech.
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: The input text is processed by the `pyttsx3` library, which converts the text to spoken words.
- **Loop and Termination**: The program runs in a continuous loop, processing multiple inputs until the user types "stop".

### Example Usage

1. Run the `echoengine.py` script.
2. Enter the text you want to be spoken when prompted.
3. The application will read out the text.
4. Type "stop" to exit the application.
